# Enrom
Solution to Enrom analysis 
# Problems in Data Set :
After getting into AWS and setting up the account , I got the snapshot of Enrom Data but I was facing  issues to unzip the files so my script can read the directories and provide the solution to the problem . I have attached the screenshot for that.
# What I did :
I used data from some other source at the as sample data to ready my script. (Below Link for the data set )
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/
And as per plan after successfully testing my logic on the sample I will put that on the data set on AWS.
# Assumptions:
1. For count of sent emails and counting the recipients I am only accessing folders which contain sent emails .
2. For word count I am counting all the words in the email .

Email.py is the main script .
